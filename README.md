## How to Run the Program
To run the program, follow these steps:
1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the directory where `myprogram.py` is located.
3. Type `python myprogram.py train.csv [test.csv]`, replacing `train.csv` and `test.csv` with the names of your training and test data files, respectively. If you don't have a test data file, you can omit the `[test.csv]` argument.
